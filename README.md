# IRON
 A simple app that lets you shop for a variety of golf related items
**Abdu**

## Description
I built a simple API that includes two arrays, each array being filled with objects; I used this API to create a e-commerce like webpage. This app is revolved around "Golf equipments shopping" so when an item is added to the "cart" you will be alerted at the top of the screen; as you add items to your "cart" the total price will increment by the price of each added item; you can also clear your cart with one click!

## Setup&Installation Requirements
* [Clone the repo](https://github.com/abdu-10/phase-1-final-project.git)
* use json-server to install and access server
> Alternatively access the deployed project [here](https://abdu-10.github.io/phase-1-final-project/)
## Minimal Viable Product
  * User will be able to add item to cart by pressing a 'add item' button (click)
  * When 'add item' button is click an alert will show saying 'item was added' (alert)
  * List out items when page loads (DOMContentLoaded)
  * There will be a 'clear cart' button that restarts all counters (click)
  * There will be a user form with two input boxes and one submit button that adds a users email and name to db.json
  * When item is clicked a counter will increment by the price of added item

## Features
- The header has a pixilized golf figure with the letters SHOT
- Below the header there is the container that holds the "Clear cart" button" and the total price count
- Displays golf related items, for each item an image of the item, a price, an item name and a button to add that item to your "cart"
- Each item card is displayed when the dom is loaded
- At the very bottom of the page there is an email sign up form where users can add their name and email that will be stored in the same API as the golf items

## Requirements
* use json-server to install and access server

>**NOTE**: This app is a single page application
